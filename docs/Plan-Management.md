### Plans  
Plan is nothing but group of offers. These offers can either be Microsoft provided or your custom offers. You must have a plan in order to add or onboard a customer. Also, you can bundle your custom offers with Microsoft provided ones & sell on your own prices.  

### Non Shareable plan  
Non shareable plan is a simple plan, in which you can't share the offers between normal offers(can be either MS provided, your custom made offer or both) and composite offers(You can find more about composite offers in coming section ).If you purchase any offer from Non-shareable plan, it will create a new subscription instance in Partner Center.
### Shareable plan  
If you purchase any offer from a shareable plan it will create a new subscription. But in case, if you already have that subscription it will just increase the number of quantity of subscribed offer. It gives you flexiblity to share the offers between  normal offers and composite ones. It is recommended to use Shareable plan if you need a composite offer inside a plan.
